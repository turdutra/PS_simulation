This code was developed as part of my MSc dissertation on multiple observers attempting to violate a state-independent contextuality inequality while sharing a system. It was created to simulate various measurement rounds by the observers in an effort to detect a violation of the inequality. You can read more about it in my dissertation at this link www.repositorio.unicamp.br/acervo/detalhe/1384575ar or in the arXiv preprint here https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19564.
